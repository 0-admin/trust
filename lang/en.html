<p id="intro">
During the trench warfare<br>of World War I, peace broke out.
<br><br>

It was Christmas 1914.
Despite strict orders not to chill<br>
with the enemy, British and German soldiers left their trenches,<br>
and gathered to bury their dead, exchange gifts, and sing.
This wasn't unique. Even long before Christmas,
soldiers already had an unspoken system of "live and let live" --
a small peace in a Great War.
<br><br>

Meanwhile, the West is now at peace, and yet,
we distrust our governments, media, and <i>each other</i> more and more.
So, we gotta ask:
<b>
Why, even in the best of times, do friends become enemies?
But also why, even in the worst of times, why do enemies become friends?
</b>
<br><br>

These are complex questions, but a simple idea from game<br>
theory can help shed some light! So, to understand<br>our epidemic of distrust...

<b>THE GAME OF TRUST:</b>
<br>
There's a machine. If one player puts a coin in the machine, the <i>other</i> player gets three coins.
A player can either choose to <b>COOPERATE</b> (put in one coin), or <b>CHEAT</b> (keep their coin).
</p>
<p id="oneoff_0_btm">
But there's a problem. Think about it: if the other player CHEATS, what should you do?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_cheated">
Fair enough – if the other player won't cooperate, why should you?
</p>
<p id="oneoff_1_cooperated">
Alas, turning the other cheek just gets you slapped on that cheek.
</p>
<p id="oneoff_1_top">
Cooperating while the other person cheats means you lose a coin while they get three. (-1 vs +3)
However, both of you cheating means you both neither gain nor lose anything. (0 vs 0)
Therefore, you should <b>CHEAT</b>.
</p>
<p id="oneoff_1_btm">
But if the other player <b>COOPERATES</b>, what should you do now?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_cheated">
Wow, that's mean. And also the correct answer!
</p>
<p id="oneoff_2_cooperated">
Yeah, seems like the right thing to do... but is it the *correct* thing to do?
</p>
<p id="oneoff_2_top">
Because, if you both cooperate, you both lose one coin and gain three (+2 vs +2).
But you can do <i>even better</i> – if you cheat while they cooperate,
<i>you</i> can gain three coins at no cost, while they lose a coin. (+3 vs -1)
Therefore, you should <i>still</i> <b>CHEAT</b>.
</p>
<p id="oneoff_2_btm">
blah blah blah blah. But what if...

GRUDGER: "Listen y'all – I start Cooperatin', and I'll keep on Cooperatin'... but if you ever Cheat me once, pardner, I AIN'T EVER FORGIVIN' YOU."
<br><br>
DETECTIVE: "First: I analyze you. I start: Cooperate, Cheat, Cooperate, Cooperate. Then: if you retaliated with a Cheat, I switch to playing Copycat. But: if you never fight back, I switch to Always Cheat. My dear Watson: elementary."

<p id="tournament_winner">
COPYCAT! (Note: this play-style is also known in game theory as "Tit For Tat")
<br><br>
Congrats, you placed your bet on the right horse.
<br><br>
Sorry, //////.
<br><br>
Now, here's the strange thing: Copycat can _never_ beat another player in the trust game (because it never tries to take advantage of others), it can only ever do _as well as_ the other player. And yet overall, Copycat wins! This, despite being simpler than Detective, nicer than Always Cheat, and more forgiving than Grudger. It almost seems to imply that the Golden Rule is not just a moral truth, but a *mathematical* truth:
<br><br>
*Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.* ~Copycat
<br><br>
And *that's* why "peace" broke out in the trenches of World War I. Each side was playing a deadly game of trust with each other, but because the nature of trench warfare means they have to face the same group of soldiers over and over again, that allowed a Copycat-like strategy – the unspoken law of "live and let live" – to evolve.
