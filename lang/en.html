<p id="intro">
During the trench warfare<br>of World War I, peace broke out.
<br><br>

It was Christmas 1914.
Despite strict orders not to chill<br>
with the enemy, British and German soldiers left their trenches,<br>
and gathered to bury their dead, exchange gifts, and sing.
This wasn't unique. Even long before Christmas,
soldiers already had an unspoken system of "live and let live" --
a small peace in a Great War.
<br><br>

Meanwhile, the West is now at peace, and yet,
we distrust our governments, media, and <i>each other</i> more and more.
So, we gotta ask:
<b>
Why, even in the best of times, do friends become enemies?
But also why, even in the worst of times, why do enemies become friends?
</b>
<br><br>

These are complex questions, but a simple idea from game<br>
theory can help shed some light! So, to understand<br>our epidemic of distrust...

<b>THE GAME OF TRUST:</b>
<br>
There's a machine. If one player puts a coin in the machine, the <i>other</i> player gets three coins.
A player can either choose to <b>COOPERATE</b> (put in one coin), or <b>CHEAT</b> (keep their coin).
</p>
<p id="oneoff_0_btm">
But there's a problem. Think about it: if the other player CHEATS, what should you do?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_1_cheated">
Fair enough – if the other player won't cooperate, why should you?
</p>
<p id="oneoff_1_cooperated">
Alas, turning the other cheek just gets you slapped on that cheek.
</p>
<p id="oneoff_1_top">
Cooperating while the other person cheats means you lose a coin while they get three. (-1 vs +3)
However, both of you cheating means you both neither gain nor lose anything. (0 vs 0)
Therefore, you should <b>CHEAT</b>.
</p>
<p id="oneoff_1_btm">
But if the other player <b>COOPERATES</b>, what should you do now?
</p>

<p id="oneoff_2_cheated">
Wow, that's mean. And also the correct answer!
</p>
<p id="oneoff_2_cooperated">
Yeah, seems like the right thing to do... but is it the *correct* thing to do?
</p>
<p id="oneoff_2_top">
Because, if you both cooperate, you both lose one coin and gain three (+2 vs +2).
But you can do <i>even better</i> – if you cheat while they cooperate,
<i>you</i> can gain three coins at no cost, while they lose a coin. (+3 vs -1)
Therefore, you should <i>still</i> <b>CHEAT</b>.
</p>
<p id="oneoff_2_btm">
blah blah blah blah. But what if...
