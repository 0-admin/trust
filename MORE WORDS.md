THE CORE WHY: WHY TEACH THIS?
To create a trustful world
therefore, understand the conditions of trust, its mechanisms

And your total score is...
BIG NUMBER    which is, wow, actually _impressively_ bad. // 8
              which, uh, could be worse! // 9 to 21
              which ain't bad! // 22 to 34
              which is pretty good! // 34 to 48
              which is actually _perfect_ // 49
              which i have no idea how you accomplished
             (the lowest & highest possible scores
              are 8 and 49, respectively.)

So who were these strange characters you just played against?

COPYCAT: 

Hello! I start with Cooperate, and afterwards, I just copy whatever you did in the last round. Meow

ALWAYS CHEAT: 

_the strong shall eat the weak_

ALWAYS COOPERATE: 

Let's be best friends! <3

GRUDGER: 

Listen, stranger. I'll start cooperatin', and keep cooperation', but if y'all ever cheat me, I'LL CHEAT YOU BACK TIL THE END OF DAYS.

DETECTIVE:

First: I analyze you. I start: Cooperate, Cheat, Cooperate, Cooperate. If you cheat back, I'll act like Copycat. If you never cheat back, I'll act like Always Cheat, to exploit you. Elementary.

Now what if these characters were to play...

...against each other?
